How to Play!

"Go Fish is a classic playing card game where the winner is the player with the most sets.\nA set is four of the same rank of card. For example, four queens in hand is one set.\nTo get sets, players must ask for a card they have on their turn - click a card in your hand then click the player you suspect has that card.\nIf the player is correct, they get another turn else they are told to 'go fish'.\nThis means the player must draw from the deck (if possible).\nOnce they do this their turn is over and the game continues until the deck is empty and all cards have been collected into sets."
