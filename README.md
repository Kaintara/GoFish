# GoFish
A mobile app where a player can play go fish solo against bots or play locally with friends. 

For anyone taking a peek at my hackatime for this project, the unknown language is kivy as seen in the gofish.kv files. It's used to develop the user interface for the game and makes it cross-platform!

Features!

- Bot Players with varying difficulty.
- 200+ Game Themes to choose from!

Reflection:

I developed this game, so I could play go fish 

I learnt how to create game trees, how to use the material designs themes
