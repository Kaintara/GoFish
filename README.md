# GoFish
A mobile app where a player can play go fish solo against bots. 

For anyone taking a peek at my hackatime for this project, the unknown language is kivy as seen in the gofish.kv files. It's used to develop the user interface for the game and makes it cross-platform!

Features!

- Bot Players with varying difficulty.
- 200+ Game Themes to choose from!
- Statistics Menu to show off your best scores!

Game Mechanics:

- Click on a card to ask for it
- Click on the icon of the player you want to ask
- Click any icon to find out helpful info such as set count and number of cards in hand
- Click on your own icon to sort the cards in your hand
- Be Successfull! Or not and have to take a card from the deck by clicking on it
- Dialog pop-up each turn describing what other player have done

Reflection:

I developed this game, so I could play my favourite cards games when I have no access to the internet or friends to play with. I thought that Go Fish is the simplest card game I know so I decided to use this to learn about game trees and how to implement them into code. I also learnt alot more about how to develop a user interface then from my last app.

Difficult Parts:

- Creating the Bot decisions, the game trees were hard to understand and even after I developed them they were quite biased causing them to make stupid decisions so I had to learn to elimate bias as well.
- Creating the User Interface, especially regarding the gameplay as I struggled with generating cards and making them look centered and similar to real playing cards
- Overall Size of the Game: This is the biggest project that I've worked on and I realised that I had not done sufficent planning for it. I found it very hard to keep track of what features I need to implement first and how to debug them as I was scrolling a lot to get to on particular sections of the code.

This is first version of the Go Fish Mobile App, I have plans for features to come! (If you were wondering about the 'tryagain.py that is a file containing all my scrapped features I failed to implement that I want to try again at haha... For example: pass and play multiplayer and animations.)
