# GoFish
A cross-platform app designed mainly for mobile where a player can play go fish locally with three or more players. 

For anyone taking a peek at my hackatime for this project, the unknown language is kivy as seen in the gofish.kv files. It's used to develop the user interface for the game and makes it cross-platform!
